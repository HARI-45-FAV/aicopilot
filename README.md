🧠 AI Health Co-Pilot

An AI-Native Consumer Health Experience

“Understand food labels like a human, not a scientist.”

📌 Overview

AI Health Co-Pilot is an AI-native web application that helps people understand food ingredients at the moment decisions matter.

Instead of dumping ingredient lists or scientific explanations, the system acts like a smart co-pilot:

It reads ingredients

Infers what matters

Explains in simple, human language

Communicates uncertainty honestly

Gives a clear, actionable verdict

This project was built for the Code To Innovate Hackathon under the problem statement:

Designing AI-Native Consumer Health Experiences

❓ The Problem

Food labels today are:

Optimized for regulatory compliance, not humans

Full of chemical names most people don’t understand

Often contradictory or confusing

Consumers are expected to interpret:

Long ingredient lists

Unfamiliar additives

Mixed or evolving health guidance

As a result, people feel uncertain exactly when they need clarity.

💡 Our Solution

We reimagined the experience by making AI the interface, not a feature.

Instead of forms, filters, or databases, users simply:

Scan a product label or

Paste ingredients text

The system then:

Infers user intent

Reasons under uncertainty

Translates complexity into clarity

Delivers a verdict designed for common people
